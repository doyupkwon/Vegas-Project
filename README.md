The SQL Dataprep file is used to pull desired data from the mysql repository. Alter longitude latitude and detector id to specify which detectors from which stretch of highway you want. This file also creates a csv file of longitude and latitude files of the selected detectors
The data concatenation file is used to put together different combinations of sensors to specify which detectors to study (main and upstream, just main, main and ramps, etc.)
